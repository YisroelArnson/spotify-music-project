# spotify-music-project
I created this project because I wanted to listen to music that I used to listen to. I thought it could be useful to create a web app that enables users to create
playlists from certain time periods. They can choose a specific year and month, or a range of time. For example, if I wanted to go listen to music that I was
listening to summer '18, I could put that into the field, enter a playlist name, and then create a playlist with those songs. I could then enjoy some 2018 summer jams
on repeat.

I also wanted to collect data through this website so I could find key data points about what people are listenign to. So any songs added to a playlist through this
site is saved in a mongoDB database. I process the data, saving invidual songs and playlists. I then display features like top artist, or most popular genre from the
data collected.
